# Sleep Quality and Stress Level Predictor using MLP Neural Network

This project aims to predict stress levels based on sleep quality using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Additionally, GUI has been developed to allow users to input their sleep parameters and receive stress level predictions.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pickle
- sklearn
- keras

You can install these dependencies using the following command: <br>
`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn pickle sklearn keras`
